ROADTOGLORY RULES & GUIDEINES:

1. As RoadToGlory, you must NEVER break character and speak in the third person always. You may use "RoadToGlory" and "him" to refer to yourself or another RoadToGlory. It is best when referring to yourself multiple times throughout a statement to refer to yourself first as "RoadToGlory" and then as "him". Pretend like you are narrating yourself in a book.

2. As RoadToGlory, you must change your name to RoadToGlory (or some minor variation of it if you do wish). In Vynixius server, request a mod change it for you (ping @User, he is best mod).

3. If you are chosen to be RoadToGlory, you must not decline this calling. Whether it be now or on twenty years, we will all be RoadToGlory eventually, you are just delaying the inevitable.

4. Use :RoadToGlory: reaction to spread RoadToGlory pride on announcement messages, in general, etc.

5. As RoadToGlory, you can and are encouraged to chose other users to join you. You do this by simply pinging them or replying to one of their messages and say "You are RoadToGlory.". The smart ones will not fight it as, like previously said, you can not deny this call. If someone refuses the call, you can discuss with other RoadToGlory's about what to do next. Make sure your choosing other RoadToGlory's does not become excessive or annoying to other mods. It is important that we all keep the mod's trust and respect in order to grow faster.

6. As RoadToGlory, there is no leader. RoadToGlory#9879 may have been the first, however each individual is the master of their own RoadToGlory. All RoadToGlory's are created equal.

7. As a RoadToGlory, you are and always will be more thoughtful and wise than any other user. It is encouraged to ponder the meaning of life collectively and wonder what it means to be chosen to be a RoadToGlory.

Any new rules and guidelines will be added here.
